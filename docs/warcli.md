# `warcli`

The command-line interface tool for Warnet.

Once `warnet` is running it can be interacted with using the cli tool `warcli`.

Most `warcli` commands accept a `--network` option, which allows you to specify
the network you want to control. This is set by default to `--network="warnet"`
to simplify default operation.

Execute `warcli --help` or `warcli help` to see a list of command categories.

`warcli` commands are organized in a hierarchy of categories and subcommands.
